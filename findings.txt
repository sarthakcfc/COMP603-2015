1) Compiler: Tiny C Compiler

2) Functions
	a) Scan/Lex/Tokenize : tccoff.c (scans the input file, find association between source file and function)
	d) parse : tccpp.c (searches the file for keywords, allocates new tokens)
	e) AST :
	f) Optimization :
	g) Code generation : c67-gen.c, i386.gen.c, x86_64-gen.c (these files return registers for function and do data relocations for specific processors.)


3) 7x faster than gcc.
 Should have had more comments on top of each source file explain what the file is for.
